# sentiment_analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It helps in understanding the sentiment expressed in a sentence, paragraph, or document. This technique is widely used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand sentiment analysis.

This repository leverages machine learning models trained on data sourced from Kaggle to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis tasks.

Actions performed:-
Data Acquisition: The project utilizes datasets sourced from Kaggle, which contain labeled examples of text data with associated sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).

Preprocessing: Text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare it for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data. These features serve as inputs to machine learning models for sentiment classification.

Model Training: Machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks) are trained on the preprocessed data to predict sentiment labels for new text inputs.

Evaluation: The performance of trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their effectiveness in sentiment classification.
